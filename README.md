Welcome to Barista Basics!

Here, I will teach you how to brew coffee using several different methods.
These methods will all be ways you can make at home using equipment a majority of people already own or use.
Learning from this page will, ideally, amplify the way you make coffee at home and help you develop a deeper palate and understanding of coffee.

- A little about me;
I am a Barista based in NYC and I love to help people learn more about coffee. 
To me, coffee is more than just a morning pick me up, and I hope after reading through this webpage, you will have created a deeper connection to your mornings.
Having worked as a barista for more than 4 years now and now as a web developer, on my days away from work, I develop my coffee and code skills together.
I believe that a single good cup of coffee goes a longer way than mindlessly drinking coffee for its caffine.
Coffee has a much deeper philosophy than the general public might know about.

I hope from this experience, you have developed a deeper understanding and appreciation for the art that is coffee!


- Now a little about the code;
This webpage is developed using NextJs, with its main focus being the design.
I am slowly transitioning myself to be more front end / design focused and this will be my first project with that goal.
This app came to fruition (pun intended, get it? coffee comes from a fruit hehe) when my girlfriend suggested I create an app that can teach people to make coffee.
While going through this webpage, I plan to implement a simple yet effective strategy of design; Minimalism.
By keeping the landing page minimal, it draws the users focus on the main goal, learning how to brew coffee.
I plan to add animations using GSAP, videos and step by step instructions on how to brew coffee using different methods.

My stretch goal for this project is to implement a 3JS object into the webpage to add more interactivity and also visually pleasing objects.

- Closing notes;
That's all from me!
I started developing this web app on 9/29/23, this is the second rendition of the app (first build failed)
Track my progress through git!
I hope you take either coffee knowledge or even maybe design examples away from this experience.
Enjoy learning how to make coffee!
