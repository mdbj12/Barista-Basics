                        Known by many names, Drip coffee is a longtime household staple.
                        Auto drip coffee is usually brewed with a machine that automates the brewing process.
                        Simply put, all it requires is coffee grounds and water.
                        These machines heat water that is usually held in a chamber, and then automatically pours it over the grounds in a filter basket.
                        The machine also comes with a pot, where the coffee will drip into overtime.
                        Due to its ease of use and high yeild, its a great option for someone who needs a large amount of coffee in a short period of time.
